## Workflow

1. First, think through the problem. Read the codebase and write a plan in task/todo.md
2. The plan should be a checklist of todo items.
3. Check in with me before starting work. I will verify the plan and provide feedback.
4. Then, complete the todos one by one, marking them off as you go.
5. At every step, give me high-level explanations of what you're doing and changed.
6. Keepe very change simple and minimal. Don't over-engineer.
7. At the end, add a review section in todo.md summarizing what you've done and what you've learned.
